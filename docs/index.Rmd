Hi, I'm Mason Reed! I'm a student at UT Austin, and I love this amazing class SDS375: Data Product Development taught by the GOAT Dr. Roger Peng. I've always had an interest in statistics since learning about the ways data shifted strategies in basketball and baseball. It's applications in other areas like finance and healthcare is also incredibly fascinating to me. In my spare time I like to go to the gym and throw my friends' League Of Legends games. I hope that this course gives me a better understanding on how data is transformed in order to provide understandable insights to users of differing backgrounds.
